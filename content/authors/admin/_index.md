I am an ecologist broadly interested in investigating the distribution, structure and functioning of aquatic microbial communities by bringing together ecological theory and omics data. I am currently a PhD student conducting a project on large-scale ecology & biogeography of marine planktonic communities using Metabarcoding, Metagenomics & Single Cell Genomics.
