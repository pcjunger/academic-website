I am an ecologist by heart and trained as an aquatic microbial ecologist. At some point I got amazed about the fact that tiny creatures have shaped our planet and still play essential trophic & bigeochemical roles at a global scale. Since then I have been broadly interested in investigating the distribution, structure and functioning of aquatic microbial communities. For that I attempt to bring together ecological theory and omics data.

I am a PhD student between in the Department of Hydrobiology (UFSCar, Brazil) and the Institut de Ciències del Mar (ICM-CSIC; Barcelona) where I am currently conducting a project on large-scale ecology & biogeography of marine planktonic communities using Metabarcoding, Metagenomics & Single Cell Genomics.

I truly believe in open science and team efforts.
