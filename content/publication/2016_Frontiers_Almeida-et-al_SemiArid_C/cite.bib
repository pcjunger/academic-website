	abstract = {Recent studies from temperate lakes indicate that eutrophic systems tend to emit less carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and bury more organic carbon (OC) than oligotrophic ones, rendering them CO<sub>2</sub> sinks in some cases. However, the scarcity of data from tropical systems is critical for a complete understanding of the interplay between eutrophication and aquatic carbon (C) fluxes in warm waters. We test the hypothesis that a warm eutrophic system is a source of both CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> to the atmosphere, and that atmospheric emissions are larger than the burial of OC in sediments. This hypothesis was based on the following assumptions: (i) OC mineralization rates are high in warm water systems, so that water column CO<sub>2</sub> production overrides the high C uptake by primary producers, and (ii) increasing trophic status creates favorable conditions for CH<sub>4</sub> production. We measured water-air and sediment-water CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes, CH<sub>4</sub> diffusion, ebullition and oxidation, net ecosystem production (NEP) and sediment OC burial during the dry season in a eutrophic reservoir in the semiarid northeastern Brazil. The reservoir was stratified during daytime and mixed during nighttime. In spite of the high rates of primary production (4858 ± 934 mg C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>), net heterotrophy was prevalent due to high ecosystem respiration (5209 ± 992 mg C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>). Consequently, the reservoir was a source of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (518 ± 182 mg C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>). In addition, the reservoir was a source of ebullitive (17 ± 10 mg C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) and diffusive CH<sub>4</sub> (11 ± 6 mg C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>). OC sedimentation was high (1162 mg C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>), but our results suggest that the majority of it is mineralized to CO<sub>2</sub> (722 ± 182 mg C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) rather than buried as OC (440 mg C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>). Although temporally resolved data would render our findings more conclusive, our results suggest that despite being a primary production and OC burial hotspot, the tropical eutrophic system studied here was a stronger CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> source than a C sink, mainly because of high rates of OC mineralization in the water column and sediments.},
